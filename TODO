* unsigned char vs signed char vs char: which is most legal for aliasing values?
* use ms_struct pragma for compatibility with MSVC?
  + Note: packed structs should be identical in both compilers as long as the
    ABIs agree (i.e. primitive types are same size)
* use #pragma pack instead? it would be identical to msvc at least
